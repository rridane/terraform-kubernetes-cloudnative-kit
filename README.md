# Terraform Kubernetes CloudNative Kit

The **CloudNative Kit** is a collection of Terraform modules designed for companies that want to **industrialize and automate Kubernetes** without unnecessary complexity.

The goal: to provide **ready-to-use cloud-native building blocks**.

With this kit, you can:
- deploy networking, security, IAM, and observability components in a standardized way,
- automate processes that are usually heavy and manual,
- reduce the time and cost required to reach a **high level of cloud-native maturity**.
